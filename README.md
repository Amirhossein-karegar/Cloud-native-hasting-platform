☁️ Cloud Native Hosting Platform

This project is a next-generation hosting platform built with Microservices architecture and DevOps/Cloud-Native tools.
The goal is to implement a modern and scalable hosting system with full automation — from server provisioning to monitoring and CI/CD.

🏗 Architecture Overview

Infrastructure as Code → Terraform + Ansible

Microservices → Python (FastAPI) / Go + PostgreSQL

CI/CD → GitHub Actions / Jenkins

Containerization → Docker + Kubernetes (Helm, Ingress, Service Mesh)

Monitoring & Logging → Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger

Security → Vault, RBAC, Trivy

🚀 Project Roadmap

1. Provision infrastructure with Terraform + Ansible


2. Develop microservices and Dockerize them


3. Set up the CI/CD pipeline


4. Deploy services on Kubernetes (Helm + Service Mesh)


5. Implement observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger)


6. Add security & GitOps (Vault, ArgoCD)

🎯 Final Goal

To build a Cloud-Native Hosting Platform that is:

Fully automated (provisioning + deployment)

Scalable and production-ready for high traffic

Enterprise-grade in monitoring and security

Usable both as a portfolio project and as a real-world product
