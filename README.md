This project is a **next-generation hosting platform** built with **Microservices architecture** and **Cloud-Native/DevOps tools**.  
The goal is to build a modern, scalable, and fully automated hosting system — from infrastructure provisioning to CI/CD and monitoring.  

---

## 🏗 Architecture Overview  

- **Infrastructure as Code** → Terraform + Ansible  
- **Microservices** → Python (FastAPI) / Go + PostgreSQL  
- **CI/CD** → GitHub Actions / Jenkins  
- **Containerization** → Docker + Kubernetes (Helm, Ingress, Service Mesh)  
- **Monitoring & Logging** → Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger  
- **Security** → Vault, RBAC, Trivy

## 🚀 Roadmap  

1. Provision infrastructure with Terraform + Ansible  
2. Develop and Dockerize microservices  
3. Implement CI/CD pipelines  
4. Deploy workloads on Kubernetes (Helm + Service Mesh)  
5. Set up monitoring & observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Jaeger)  
6. Add security & GitOps (Vault, ArgoCD)  

---

## 🎯 Final Goal  

Build a **Cloud-Native Hosting Platform** that is:  
- Fully automated (provisioning + deployment)  
- Scalable and ready for production traffic  
- Equipped with enterprise-grade monitoring and security  
- Usable both as a **portfolio project** and as a **real-world market solution**
